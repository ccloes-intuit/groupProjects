#Hey everyone

* I created a directory for each of you.  Please put your code in your respective project/directory
* I also created an "orig" directory with the code we found the first day in case you want to use it still as a reference

## Use branches and pull requests
* Its a good excercise but may require some learning
* Let me know I can help before class one day if you are interested
